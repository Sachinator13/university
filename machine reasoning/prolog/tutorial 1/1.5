append_list([], L2, L2).

append_list([X|L1],L2,[X|L3]) :-
    append_list(L1,L2,L3).




------------------------
?- append_list([a, b, c], [p, q], Ans).

Ans = [a, b, c, p, q]




How it works: the worst case scenario is when L1 is empty, and 
then it rplaces L3 with L2. We work towards this by slowly 
reducing the size of list 1. eventually, when we reach 0, 
L2 will take the palce of L3, and then we work backwards and 
append the last value of L1 onto teh start of L3 and contine
backwards until the list is fully appended.
